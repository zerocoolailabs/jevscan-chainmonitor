"""Wallets paid by a mixer, from the mixers' own payout logs, so "was this sender funded by a mixer?" is a local lookup.

A Tornado-style pool emits Withdrawal(address to, bytes32 nullifierHash, address indexed relayer, uint256 fee) on
every payout, and `to` is the first word of the log data. One eth_getLogs sweep over the labeled mixer contracts lists
every payout ever made (two years: about 99,000 payouts in under a minute); a live monitor would extend the same list
from the logs of each new block it already reads. This replaces asking Etherscan for every sender's first transfers,
which was the slowest step of a run and missed payouts beyond the first page of results.

Not covered: mixers that do not emit this event (Privacy Pools, Railgun) and funds that pass through one more wallet
before reaching the sender.

Collection builds the finalized mixer index on first use and extends it before every run.
