"""The lookups a window's transactions need beyond their own data: prices, code, contract creation, balances one
block earlier, sender funding, source verification, and function names. All I/O of the facts layer is here, and rpc.py
caches every successful cacheable response locally.

Etherscan reads are skipped for trivial transactions, except the
creation date of a labeled contract, which the 30-day label rule needs. Whether a mixer paid the sender comes from the
local payout list (mixers.py), not from Etherscan; a sender's first funding is still an Etherscan read, made
only for wallets with few prior transactions, where wallet age matters.
